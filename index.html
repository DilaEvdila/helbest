    <h2>What Is Poetry, and How Is It Different?</h2>
    <img id="firstpoem" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/GilgameshTablet.jpg" alt="First Pem" height="200">
    <p>There are as many definitions of poetry as there are poets. William Wordsworth defined poetry as <em> "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings."</em>Emily Dickinson said, "If I read a book and it makes my body so cold no fire ever can warm me, I know that is poetry." Dylan Thomas defined poetry this way: "Poetry is what makes me laugh or cry or yawn, what makes my toenails twinkle, what makes me want to do this or that or nothing."</p>

        Poetry is a lot of things to a lot of people. Homer's epic, "The Odyssey," described the wanderings of the adventurer, Odysseus, and has been called the greatest story ever told. During the English Renaissance, dramatic poets such as John Milton, Christopher Marlowe, and of course, William Shakespeare gave us enough words to fill textbooks, lecture halls, and universities. Poems from the Romantic period include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's "Faust" (1808), Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" (1816), and John Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn" (1819).
